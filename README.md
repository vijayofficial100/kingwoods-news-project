AI-Assisted Web Project

This repository represents my self-learning journey into software systems.

I independently designed and managed a live news website (🔗https://kingwoodsnews.com,🔗https://cinirocket.com/,🔗 https://seithipunal.com /)
using AI tools like ChatGPT to understand structure, logic, and workflows.

## What I learned
- Website architecture basics
- Logical flow of systems
- Debugging and problem-solving with AI assistance
- Continuous self-learning without formal coding background

## Tech Exposure
- Python (Basics – learning)
- Git & GitHub
- AI tools for development learning

Note:
This repository focuses on learning and documentation.
More structured code projects will be added as I progress.
